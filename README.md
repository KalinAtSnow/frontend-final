# Advanced Frontend Final

## Project Description

This project will helps players of Trading Card Games (TCG) to add to and track their inventories by set, view popular decks, import decklists and more. It would allow players to see what cards they need to buy in order to build a deck that they want and potentially link them to sites to buy said cards.

I will be working on this project by myself. I am still looking into what framework to use, but I will likely use Vite with a C# backend

## Project Requirements

The project will be able to do the following:

1. Allow users to create an account
2. Allow users to save cards to their inventory
3. Allow users to view their inventory
4. Allow users to view popular decks
5. Allow users to import decklists
6. Allow users to view their decks
7. Allow users to buy the cards that they are missing

## A list of new things you will need to do to accomplish your project (e.g. websockets)

Looking at some of the firefox browser apis, I might be able to work with the clipboard api to add lists to the clipboard. It might also be fun to do something with the vibration api for mobile devices. I will also likely need to find someone's api to get some data that I can fetch on occasion
